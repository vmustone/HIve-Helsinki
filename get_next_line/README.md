# Get Next Line

**Description**  
The **get_next_line** project is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. The goal is to implement a function that can handle reading data from a file (or standard input) one line at a time, even when dealing with large files or streams. The project focuses on handling memory efficiently, especially by using static variables to preserve the state between function calls.

## Key Concepts

- **Reading from File Descriptors**:  
  The function reads data from a file descriptor (`int fd`) and processes it character by character until a newline (`\n`) is encountered or the end of the file is reached.
  
- **Static Variables**:  
  The function uses static variables to retain the current position in the file across multiple function calls. This is crucial because it allows `get_next_line` to "remember" its state between reads, without needing to pass extra state information.

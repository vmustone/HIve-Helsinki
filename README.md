# Hive Helsinki School Projects  

**Description**  
This repository showcases the projects I completed during my studies at Hive Helsinki. The curriculum is designed to build programming skills from the ground up, starting with low-level C programming and evolving to advanced topics like C++ and full-stack web development. Each project emphasizes a specific aspect of software development, from memory management to object-oriented programming and web application development.

## Key Projects  

### **Libft**  
The first project of the curriculum, Libft, is a custom implementation of the standard C library. It provided a foundation in:  
- Memory management  
- String manipulation  
- Reusable code design  

### **Fract-ol**  
A graphical project that introduced 2D rendering concepts by visualizing fractals like the Mandelbrot set. Key skills included:  
- Mathematical transformations  
- Graphics rendering using the MiniLibX library  

### **MiniShell**  
A collaborative project to build a functional Unix shell from scratch. Highlights:  
- Process management using `fork` and `exec`  
- Signal handling  
- Parsing and implementing shell built-ins  

### **Inception**  
Focused on containerization and system architecture using Docker. Key learnings included:  
- Docker Compose to manage multi-container setups  
- Deployment of services like databases, web servers, and applications  

### **Transcendence**  
The final project of the curriculum, Transcendence, is a full-stack web application. Key features:  
- Real-time communication using WebSockets  
- Backend in **Django** 
- Frontend in **javaScript**

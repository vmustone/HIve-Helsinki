# Libft

**Description**  
Libft is a custom implementation of the standard C library. It is the first project at Hive Helsinki that involves recreating many commonly used functions from `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, and other standard libraries. The goal is to deepen understanding of low-level programming and memory management in C while building a reusable library for future projects.
